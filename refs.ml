                 Section 1: Mutable Lists and Cycles
                             Spring 2018

(* The type of mutable lists. *)
type 'a mlist = Nil | Cons of 'a * 'a mlist ref

(*......................................................................
Problem 1: Write a function has_cycle that returns whether a mutable
list has a cycle. You may want a recursive helper function. Don't
worry about space usage.
......................................................................*)
                                      
let has_cycle (lst : 'a mlist) : bool =
  failwith "has_cycle not implemented"

(*......................................................................
Problem 2: Write a function flatten that flattens a list (removes its
cycles if it has any) destructively. Again, you may want a recursive
helper function and you shouldn't worry about space.
......................................................................*)
let flatten (lst : 'a mlist) : unit =
  failwith "flatten not implemented"

(*......................................................................
Problem 3: Write mlength, which nondestructively finds the number of
nodes in a mutable list that may have cycles.
......................................................................*)
let mlength (lst : 'a mlist) : int =
  failwith "mlength not implemented"
